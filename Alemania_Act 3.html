	<p>Algebraic Equation</p>
 
	<p>
		<b>Algebraic equation</b>, statement of the quality of two expressions formulated by applying to<br>
		a set if variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,<br>
		raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are x<sup>3</sup> + 1 and (y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy - y)/(x - 1) = 12.<br>
		An important special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the<br>
		form axn + bxn<sup>- 1</sup> + ... + gx + h = k. They have as many solutions as their degree (n), and the<br>
		search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra.<br>
		Equations like x sin (x) = c that involve non algebraic operations, such as logarithms or<br>
		trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.

	<p>Chemical Compound</p>

	<p>
		A chemical compound is a chemical subtance consisting of two or more different chemically<br>
		bonded chemical elements, with fixed ratio determining the composition.<br>
		<br>
		The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.<br>
		<br>
		For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen<br>
		atom.<br>
		<br>
		The atoms within a compound can be heid together by a variety of interactions, raging from<br>
		<br>
		A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely convalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds<br>
		<br>
		For example H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by polar covalent bonds.<br>
		<br>
		Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.
